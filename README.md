This is a prototype repository to display prototype code for simulating Gaussian Random fields in one- and two-dimensions, as well as a code giving an introduction to the (elements of) the theory. From here I plan to touch up the code and store it in a proper Python package. Methods of simulation include (i) approximate simulations using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion and (ii) exact, fast simulations using the Circulant Embedding method.
