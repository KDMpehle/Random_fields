GaussRF
--------
 A python package for numerical simulation of Gaussian random fields.

Overview
------
GaussRF contains implementations for the numerical simulation of Gaussian Random fields(RFs). There are already a few Python packages that implement algorithms for simulating Gaussian RFs. However, to the authors' knowledge there doesn't seem to be (an easily found) Python package that contains both exact and approximate methods. So far GaussRF implements one exact (The Circulant Embedding method) and one approximate (Karhunen-Loeve truncation) method. More convincingly, one of the authors has a particular interest in oceanography, and studies the numerical simulation of random fields cognizant of their applications to oceanographic contexts.
